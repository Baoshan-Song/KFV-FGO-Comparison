# README ‚Äî KFV ‚áÑ FGO Demo GUI (App Designer .mlapp)

This App is a research/demo tool to accompany our paper ‚ÄúFGO MythBusters: Explaining how Kalman Filter variants achieve the same performance as FGO in navigation applications‚Äù. It helps readers reproduce comparisons between Kalman Filter Variants (KFV: EKF/IEKF/REKF/RIEKF) and Factor Graph Optimization (FGO), including Sliding-Window FGO (SW-FGO), under consistent assumptions.

The App provides:
- One-click runs of KFV vs. FGO on synthetic datasets.
- Visualizations: 2D trajectories, error time series, error CDF, and timing.
- Parameter panels to align KFV and FGO configurations.
- A dashboard with key metrics (RMSE, timing, settings).

Note: This is an academic, transparent prototype. It prioritizes clarity and reproducibility over packaging or UI polish.

## 1. Requirements

- MATLAB R2023b or later (R2024b recommended).
- App Designer (included with MATLAB).
- Core MATLAB toolboxes:
  - Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox (for ECDF, etc.).
  - Optimization-related functions are implemented in code; no special optimization toolbox is required.
- OS: Windows/macOS/Linux supported by MATLAB.

Optional:
- Deep Learning Toolbox if you plan to explore auto-differentiation variants in your own extensions (not required for default runs).

  - FGO_KF_Simulator.mlapp ‚Äî the main App.
- config/
  - init_settings_kfv_fgo_comparison.m ‚Äî config script for KFV vs FGO experiments.
  - init_settings_swfgo.m ‚Äî config script for SW-FGO experiments.
- core/
  - estimator/ ‚Äî KfvEstimator, FgoEstimator and related estimators.
  - fgo/ ‚Äî factor graph, state, and factor definitions.

---

## 3. Installation

1) Download or clone the project to a local folder (e.g., C:\... \code\).

2) Open MATLAB and add paths:
- Open the App (gui/FGO_KF_Simulator.mlapp) in App Designer, or simply run the App from MATLAB.
- The App‚Äôs startup function automatically adds the necessary project subfolders to the path. If you run code manually, ensure config/, core/, core/estimator/, core/filter/, core/fgo/, data/ are on MATLAB path.

3) Verify data and config:
- config/init_settings_kfv_fgo_comparison.m and config/init_settings_swfgo.m must exist.
- data/ must contain the referenced .mat dataset (default: circle_cv_gmm_L1.mat).

---

## 4. Quick Start

- Start MATLAB.
- Open and run the App: gui/FGO_KF_Simulator.mlapp.
- The App will:
  - Load default configurations (KFV + FGO; SW-FGO).
  - Attempt to auto-load the default dataset from config.
- If data is not found, click the folder button (üìÅ) and pick a .mat dataset containing true_positions (and other fields used in the paper).

Recommended first run:
- Use the default ‚ÄúComparison between KFV and FGO‚Äù tab.
- Keep default parameters (EKF, small window, mild thresholds).
- Click the green Run button (‚ñ∂).

You will see:
- 2D trajectory plot (true vs. KFV vs. FGO).
- Error series (KFV vs. FGO).
- Error CDF (KFV vs. FGO).
- Processing time bars and dashboard stats.

---

## 5. UI Guide

Main areas:
- Top-left canvas (UIAxes): 2D trajectory and anchor points.
- Right panels:
  - ErrorAxes: error time series (KFV vs. FGO).
  - CPUAxes: simple timing/CPU-like breakdown visualization.
  - KFVAxes: error CDF comparison or FGO CDF in SW-FGO tab.
- Dashboard (bottom-right): algorithm summary, RMSE, and timing.

Left controls:
- ? button: usage tips.
- üìÅ button: choose and load a .mat dataset.
- ‚ñ∂ button: run the current tab‚Äôs pipeline.
- üóë button: clear data (simple cleanup).
- ‚öô button: save/load parameters to/from .mat.

Tabs:
1) Comparison between KFV and FGO
   - Select KF: KF/EKF/IEKF/REKF/MIEKF/RMIEKF (paper focuses on EKF/IEKF/REKF/RIEKF).
   - Robust kernel: Huber/None/Cauchy.
   - Robust delta, Window size, Max iter, Thres. iter, Init. Cov, Propa. Noise (Q diagonals).
   - Press ‚ñ∂ to run:
     - KfvEstimator(cfg, data) ‚Üí result1
     - Convert to FGO template ‚Üí FgoEstimator(cfg, data) ‚Üí result2
     - Show trajectories, errors, CDF, and timing.

2) SW FGO Simulation
   - Configure SW-FGO: window size, iteration, thresholds, robust kernel, P0, Q.
   - Press ‚ñ∂ to run:
     - FgoEstimator(cfg, data) only (SW-FGO).
     - Plot trajectory + FGO CDF; dashboard shows SW-FGO stats.

## 6. Data Format

A minimal dataset (MAT-file) should include:
- true_positions: 2 x T ground truth trajectory.
- For KFV tab (if your filters rely on):
  - position_measurements: 2 x (T+1) or 2 x T observed positions (used by fallback KF demo).
  - pdr_positions: 2 x T control/propagation increments (optional in your own configs).
- For FGO demos:
  - toa_measurements: M x T (e.g., ranges), if range factors are used.
  - emitter_positions: 2 x M anchors/beacons.
- Other fields may be required depending on your config functions.

If unsure, start with data/circle_cv_gmm_L1.mat.

---

## 7. Reproducibility Tips

- Align KFV and FGO settings:
  - Use the same P0, Q, R, robust kernel type and delta, iteration caps, and threshold.
  - Use window size = 1 to emulate recursive filters with SW-FGO (as in the paper‚Äôs equivalence discussion).
- Initialization:
  - Ensure initial state (x0) and covariance (P0) match across KFV and FGO.
- Nonlinearity and non-Gaussian noise:
  - To test robustness, enable Huber/Cauchy and adjust delta in both KFV and FGO sides.
- Timing:
  - Timing shown is indicative and measured inside the App. For benchmarking, run multiple trials and average.

## 8. Save/Load Parameters

- Click ‚öô ‚Üí Save Params to export:
  - config_kfv_fgo (KFV+FGO comparison settings).
  - config_swfgo (SW-FGO settings).
- Click ‚öô ‚Üí Load Params to import and populate UI.

This makes it easy to share exact configurations used for figures.

---

## 9. Common Issues and Fixes

- ‚Äústate not found‚Äù or FGO classes not found:
  - Ensure core/fgo, core/estimator are on the MATLAB path. The App adds them automatically at startup; if you run standalone scripts, addpath project subfolders first.
- Dataset missing fields:
  - Use the provided example data or adapt your data to include the required fields (true_positions, emitter_positions, measurements).
- No plots/update:
  - Ensure you clicked ‚ñ∂ on the correct tab and that data is loaded.
- Inconsistent results:
  - Verify KFV and FGO share the same noise matrices, kernels, thresholds, and window size assumptions.

---

## 10. How This Connects to the Paper

- The App implements the ‚Äúequivalence under conditions‚Äù narrative:
  - With Markov assumption, linearized models, Gaussian noise, and window size = 1, SW-FGO reproduces KFV behavior.
  - By relaxing assumptions (larger window, robust kernels, iterations), SW-FGO generalizes beyond KFV.
- The visualizations mirror the paper‚Äôs figures:
  - Trajectories (true vs. KFV vs. FGO), error CDF, and timing trends.
- Use this App to explore:
  - EKF vs. FG-EKF; IEKF vs. FG-IEKF; REKF vs. FG-REKF; RIEKF vs. FG-RIEKF.
  - The effect of window size and iterations in SW-FGO (accuracy vs. cost).
